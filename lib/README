1. core-name-tbl.text ; table for translating the .sch files at sw/rhs ;
   names where either the left hand side is problematic in scheme or the right hand side is problematic in haskell

2. sch-name-tbl.text ; table for translating the .sch files at sw/rsc3

Notes:

Predicates have an _is_ prefix in places of the _?_ suffix, i.e. isPair, isList &etc.

Predicate names that exist at Haskell without an `is` prefix also have that name, i.e. null, even &etc.
