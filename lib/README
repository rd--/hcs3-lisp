1. core-name-tbl.text ; table for translating the .sch files at sw/rhs ;
   names where either the left hand side is problematic in R6RS scheme or the right hand side is problematic in haskell

2. sch-name-tbl.text ; table for translating the .sch files at sw/rsc3 and sw/rsc3-arf

Notes:

Predicate names that exist at Haskell without an `is` prefix have that name, i.e. null, even &etc.

Otherwise an `is` prefix is preferred, i.e. isPair, isList &etc.
